                    The Asian market is the obvious place for Du Val PropTech to start as that’s what my background entails,
                    but we want to work with investors all over the world. Currently from a taxation perspective, it doesn’t
                    make sense for UK investors to access the UK market. So what we’re doing is providing resources and
                    tools for investors to access opportunities within other jurisdictions that may work better for their
                    portfolio.</p>

                    Just because you’re big, doesn’t mean you’re good, and just because you’re small doesn’t mean you’re
                    bad. <br><br> Now we work with a lot of the big developers, but we are also looking for those hidden
                    gems, those smaller developers who are going to be tomorrow’s leaders. And for investors, those hidden
                    gems are where the value is. <br><br> We work with a panel of developers and we’re looking for
                    developers building extremely good quality product built for market. <br><br> What this means is we’re
                    looking for projects that we know are going to deliver, they’re going to be financially sound and other
                    thing is that the specification is right. We have a very large team based in the UK and in New Zealand
                    who are dedicated to finding these types of developments; agreeing upon dynamic pricing structures with
                    those developers and ensuring they’re bringing exactly the right product to market for our network of
                    investors. <br><br> The largest risk for most developers is sales. We’re reducing this risk for
                    developers, by cutting the cost of access to the market. So we don’t want them spending money flying
                    across the globe, staying in hotels, we provide for them the certainty of access to a large network of
                    investors, and the savings they make in return for that certainty are passed onto our investors.
